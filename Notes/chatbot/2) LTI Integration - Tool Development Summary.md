The development of an LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability) tool involves setting up a secure, standardized integration between an external tool (in this case, a Python-based chatbot application) and an LMS (Learning Management System) like Brightspace D2L. The process adheres to the LTI 1.3 specification, ensuring that the tool can be seamlessly embedded within the educational platform, providing functionalities such as user authentication, course context sharing, and potentially grade passback or roster information retrieval.

The integration primarily involves creating a Flask application to serve as the LTI Launch Server, which handles authentication and launch requests from the LMS using OAuth 2.0 and JWT for secure communication. Once authenticated, the user is redirected to the chatbot application, built with Streamlit, which is designed to interact with students or educators within the context of their course. The Flask app acts as a bridge, parsing LTI launch requests, performing necessary security checks, and then directing users to the appropriate Streamlit application based on the course or user information contained within the launch request.
