The LTI Launch Server acts as the intermediary between the LMS and the external tool, handling initial authentication, validation of LTI launch requests, and redirection of users to the chatbot application with the appropriate context and permissions. This server ensures that the external tool adheres to the LTI 1.3 specifications, facilitating secure and standardized communication between the tool and various LMS platforms.

#### Relevant Python Code (Flask App)

Here's the Python code for the Flask app acting as the LTI Launch Server:
```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify, session, redirect, url_for
from authlib.integrations.flask_client import OAuth
import os

app = Flask(__name__)
app.secret_key = os.getenv('FLASK_SECRET_KEY', 'a_secure_secret_key')

oauth = OAuth(app)
lti_tool = oauth.register(
    name='lti',
    client_id='your_client_id',
    client_secret='your_client_secret',
    authorize_url='https://example.com/authorize',
    access_token_url='https://example.com/token',
    client_kwargs={
        'scope': 'openid',
        'response_type': 'id_token',
        'response_mode': 'form_post',
        'token_endpoint_auth_method': 'client_secret_post'
    },
)

@app.route('/lti_launch', methods=['POST'])
def lti_launch():
    # Extract the ID token from the request
    id_token = request.form.get('id_token')
    # Decode the ID token to extract user and course information
    decoded_token = lti_tool.parse_id_token(id_token)
    # Example user info extraction (simplified for demonstration)
    user_info = {"role": decoded_token.get("role", "Unknown")}
    # Store user info in session for subsequent use
    session['user_info'] = user_info
    # Redirect to a display route or directly to the Streamlit app
    return redirect(url_for('display_role'))

@app.route('/display_role')
def display_role():
    # Retrieve user info from session
    user_info = session.get('user_info', {})
    # Display the user's role or other relevant information
    return jsonify(user_info)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

#### Explanation of Code

- **Flask App Initialization:** Sets up the Flask application and configures a secret key for session management.
- **OAuth Registration:** Initializes the OAuth client with the LTI tool's credentials and URLs necessary for the OAuth 2.0 flow, tailored for LTI 1.3 communication.
- **LTI Launch Handler (`/lti_launch`):** This endpoint processes POST requests from the LMS, extracting and decoding the ID token to authenticate the launch and obtain user and context information.
- **Session State Update:** User information extracted from the ID token, such as the user's role, is stored in the Flask session. This information can be used in subsequent requests to personalize the user's experience.
- **Display Role Endpoint (`/display_role`):** A simple route to demonstrate how stored session information can be accessed and returned in response to a request.

#### Running the App

1. **Environment Setup:** Ensure environment variables for `FLASK_SECRET_KEY`, `your_client_id`, and `your_client_secret` are correctly set.
2. **Start the Flask App:** Run `flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5000` in the terminal, ensuring you're in the directory of your Flask app.
3. **Parameters to Replace:**
    - `your_client_id` and `your_client_secret`: Replace with the actual credentials provided by the LMS for your LTI tool.
    - Authorization and token URLs should match those provided by your LMS or the test environment.

#### Testing and Expanding Functionality

- **Simulate an LTI Launch:** Use tools like the IMS Global LTI 1.3 Reference Implementation to simulate LTI launches and test your Flask app's response.
- **API Call to Flask from Streamlit:** To integrate with the Streamlit app, you could expose an API endpoint in your Flask app that the Streamlit app can call to retrieve session information. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how the Streamlit app might make a request to the Flask app to get the user's role:
